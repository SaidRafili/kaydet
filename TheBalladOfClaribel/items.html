                        <p>The cover of the sheet music for "Why Was I Looking Out?", an 1866 song. Lyrics are by Claribel, and they're essentially the same as those for "Through the Jessamine," but from the perspective of the other character in the story. The music for this one is by Jacques Blumenthal, and the cover bears his royalty signature of JB.</p>

                        <p>The cover of the sheet music for Claribel's song "Through the Jessamine," as well as the lyrics, which were published separately in her posthumous volume Thoughts, Verses, and Songs (1877). "Through the Jessamine" was first published in Boosey and Sons' St. James's Album for 1863, which hit stands at the end of 1862 judging by Illustrated London News advertisements, but it was also released as a separate piece of sheet music sometime later. Another item herein, "Why Was I Looking Out?", is not so much a sequel to this song as a retelling of the same story from the other party.</p>

                        <p>Screenshots of the cover and an excerpt from a song variously titled "I Love to Sing the Old Songs" and "I Like to Sing the Old Songs" - and by "variously titled" I do mean both of those titles are used on the same piece of sheet music. The words and music are by Charles Hodgson. Though the poetic style of the lyrics makes it obvious that this song is an answer to/riff off Claribel's "I Cannot Sing the Old Songs," the melody actually bears no resemblance to the original, unlike a fair few sequels or riffs of this era.</p>
